`What did you learn during this project?`

I learned a lot of things during this project. First, I learned to be more patient, because sometimes things didn’t work the way I expected. I also learned how important it is to search, explore, and try different solutions. I picked up many new skills in HTML and CSS, and I also learned that it’s okay to ask for help and learn from others. Finally, I realized how nice it feels to encourage and share ideas with others too.

`What was your biggest challenge, and how did you approach it?`
I had quite a few challenges while working on my project. The first one was figuring out what kind of information I should put on the website. In the end, I decided to write about myself and my journey, which made the project feel more personal.

Another big challenge was working with HTML and CSS. I often struggled with styling and layouts, so I spent a lot of time searching, experimenting, and asking ChatGPT for help until I found solutions.

`If you were ever stuck while working on your project, how did you get unstuck? How did you find a way to move forward?`

I got stuck many times, especially with CSS. Whenever that happened, I tried not to stress too much. I would take a step back, breathe, and then go back to testing different ideas. I also searched online and asked questions until I found a way to fix the problem. Each time I got stuck, I ended up learning something new.

`What are you most proud of in your site?`
I’m most proud that I learned so much from every part of the site. Each section was like a mini learning experience, and putting it all together showed me how much progress I made.
